R1AEL2WD0Y69DS,B0BYC52LYP,5.0 out of 5 stars Ultimate Ears best portable speaker to date!,J. Bowman,5.0,"I recently got my hands on the Ultimate Ears EVERBOOM, and let me tell you, it’s a total game changer when it comes to portable speakers! First impression? Aesthetically pleasing and surprisingly compact for the powerhouse it is! The design is sleek yet rugged, which has made it the perfect companion for both my backyard barbecues and beach days.Sound quality? Exceptional! This little gadget absolutely fills the space with rich, booming sound (pun intended!). The deep bass packs a punch without overpowering the mid and high tones, making it perfect for any genre. Whether I’m blasting some classic rock or chilling to upbeat summer tunes, it handles everything with flair. Plus, the 360-degree sound is a brilliant feature – no matter where you are, the tunes follow you around!Battery life is another big win here. I’ve taken it on numerous day trips and have yet to experience a dead battery, which is impressive considering how much I love to keep the music going! The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless, easy to pair, and stays strong even at a distance.One of my favorite features is the customizable EQ settings via the app. It's really cool being able to tweak the sound to match my mood or the vibe of the crowd. And let’s not forget the durability! This baby can handle a spill or two, and I appreciate that it’s also water-resistant.In short, the Ultimate Ears EVERBOOM has officially revolutionized my music experience. If you’re on the hunt for a portable speaker that doesn’t skimp on sound, versatility, or durability, look no further. It’s worth every penny and has already become a staple in my life. Highly recommend it to fellow music lovers! 🎶🎉","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2024",AGZHKJLEIGTVBSYRLQAQUMO54JEQ,1,3,Color: Black,Ultimate Ears,1669,282,High (4–5),False

R1LIYN6YAGMFBL,B0D6WD2QSQ,"5.0 out of 5 stars Bose does not disappoint: Amazing sound for a compact, portable speaker",Brian,5.0,"I wanted a speaker primarily for my home office to play music while I work from home. After reading reviews I decided on the Bose and wow, I'm glad I did. I've had other Bose products and regard the brand as among the upper echelon of sound equipment. For a very reasonable price the SoundLink Flex is impressive.Highs and mid-range are clear, and low-end is more substantial than expected fora compact design. The sound quality from such a small unit is amazing.Bluetooth connectivity to my iMac was a snap. This is a perfect portable sound solution, something you can take on vacation, to the park or beach, use around the house (pool, office, wherever). Would highly recommend and might just buy another.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2025",AHUFW7T6FROMK4E2MLFM2WLBGCLA,1,14,Color: Blue Dusk,Bose,707,122,High (4–5),False
R2ND8UB3QKR4XD,B09FM6PDHP,4.0 out of 5 stars JBL for the win.,Amber,4.0,"Affordable, and great all arounder. Noise cancelling is great, they fit in my ears well which I usually have trouble with. The quick start guide helped a ton figuring out all the controls, which is a must for me as I find I have a lot trouble figuring these types of things out. I think there is even an app that you can change the commands which is pretty cool! So they get an A plus for adjustability in that regard.I love the color, I chose navy but there many to choose from. I haven’t used them much for phone calls yet, but they pick up the wind a lot so I’ve chosen not to use them for most of my phone calls when I’ve had them in.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024",AHKSTPYCQ256XNBIJJNN5IKNF43A,1,1,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones,JBL,638,128,High (4–5),False

Not staying in. And my ears are pretty versatile.Which is why during Amazon Days I just purchased the Beats Fit Pro set.The sound on the Fits... Not gonna lie, huge difference in quality. Wasn't expecting it to be that different. But, alas, it is. Now with that said, these here are super affordable. If you're on a budget get them. The fits, not on sale and on sale, not for a budget audio buyer. So think about what is important as far as staying in your ears. If you're looking for a chill around the house, sure these are excellent. If you wanna run, don't. Save and get the fits.Comfortable. Weight is not heavy.

R3QIOBHH01818S,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not excellent for Beats,Amy L.,4.0,"I bought these renewed so keep that in mind before reading further. Aesthetically, he quality of the product is good, arrived clean, in the original box with charger and manuals. I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible. Ok for everyday headphones that aren't too pricey.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AE4SCIH4EIJQNY4BA7TKFA7WD6IQ,1,1,Color: WhiteStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats by Dre,1910,330,High (4–5),True

RNDGVPHO1V4I5,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Studio Buds - A Symphony of Style and Sound,dwayne taylor,4.0,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, and after spending some quality time with them, I am thoroughly impressed. These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AGIAJSPIKY6ECFRXNA6BPVLSNG3A,1,11,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats by Dre,2731,422,High (4–5),True

It’s been a few hours since I’ve been comparing these with the Bose QC and sports earbuds. Tried many songs. Bass, treble, vocals, just speech videos. These are compelling. Especially with equalizer with smart balance. Anyway, taking one star away because the alerts from both earbuds are out of sync most times. Which makes me worried whether this is going to be a problem in future. Another thing, I’m worried if my ears are gonna get sore by hours of wearing. They’re a little stuffy in the ears.But I’m definitely returning all other earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2021",AHE3L7LKFB7TNAVU74DW6UTMNWVQ,1,10,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,Bose,633,111,High (4–5),False

They fit perfect in the ear and can easily run with them without falling out. The noise canceling feature is superb. The sound quality is better than most on the market. They won the award on multiple sites for the best earbud of 2023. It's clear to see why with their sound quality. I now will be buying another set of these for my wife as I'm so pleased with them.

I already owned Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones (awesome) so I figured the earbuds should be of the same quality. I have not been disappointed. Sound quality, separation of highs and lows, noise canceling, all work for me. They are also comfortable. I've worn them for 2+ hours regularly and have not experienced any discomfort, and they do not need to be jammed in the ear canal for good sound. One improvement would be to add the feature where the volume can be reduced by tapping the earbud instead of having to hold it down, but it's a minor thing.

R2SOQ8N1C3X1JM,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Did JBL just lose?,Itryditm8,5.0,"The ULT field 1 is an incredible compact speaker. My Go-to was always the JBL flip series, as i right now own the flip 6.Design: The utility here is great, it has a carry strap that doubles as a hanger, or a handle!, the build is very rugged and high quality, i would not baby this thing at all, it handles its own!Sound & Performance: Out of the box the speaker comes with ULT on, and WOAH!, it gets very loud for its size!. This speaker connects to sony’s music center app, where you can customize the eq, connect in stereo to another field 1, and many other settings!. The sound is very open, clear on vocals ,it fills up a big room really well and maps the sound out. A really great sounding speaker. Battery life is really good,it varies how you use it, but real world use ( 50-80% volume, ULT on) its good for 8-10 hours straight. It does take a while to charge, about 5 hours if its completely drained. But thats good for the overall life of the battery.Compared to JBL flip 6: Ive been back forth between these two for the past couple days. And i found myself reaching for the field 1! It sounds better, its more open, it sounds like the music fills up any room, as for the JBL, it targets the sound directly at you, and the highs are a bit harsh, sony simply just outperforms it!Value: at retail ($128). I would buy this speaker no question. Its great and performs as well as speakers above its weight class.On sale : $98, i would buy it IMMEDIATELY:), insane value.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AGNZEIEKV6LTFUK2YDPG7DPE6SHQ,1,3,Color: Off White,JBL,1475,279,High (4–5),False
R1P2OVKCR03MLZ,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars New Sony drop is perfect for budget audiophiles,BB,5.0,"If you're on the fence, get this! I was looking for a new speaker to replace my old UE Boom that had a static tick in it (love UE, but every speaker I've had goes this route eventually).This new portable Sony speaker didn't have the thousands of reviews that more expensive (or cheaper and well-known but risker) speakers had. However, every review was positive and they were right (so far). Though I've only had this about a month, it's been a massive improvement in my home and away music setup. The sound is gorgeous. The bass is clear and deep. I'm sure audiophiles can find a $1000 speaker that will be tuned to perfection, but for music fans without those funds (and who need a trusty travel speaker) this is the one.The forest green/grey looks cool and shows off how well-made it is.Only potential con so far is that it takes a while to shut off by itself. I don't have the Sony app so maybe this is a setting you can change. It's by no means a problem, unless you are banking on it shutting itself off. The connection lasts even if your music app closes which is nice.The rope handle also makes it so you can't just slam it down; it has to be the right orientation. It's tied loosely though, so you could untie it for more position flexibility, you'd just have a longer string to carry it.I am very particular and this speaker checked all my boxes! 10/10 recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AFBXJGYWY3QZXF2IZTRJYOW3UO7A,1,0,Color: Forest Gray,Sony,1373,253,High (4–5),False

The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA,1,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,JBL,956,173,High (4–5),False

R3E39REOEKMJHO,B07DD3WBYW,2.0 out of 5 stars DO NOT BUY: Ruined my relationship with ULTIMATE EARS :(,Hailey DeArruda,2.0,"💗Let me start by saying before buying this product I have been a HUGE, longtime fan of the Ultimate Ears brand.I purchased the original Wonderboom portable bluetooth speaker maybe 5 years ago or longer? I originally purchased it because I wanted something waterproof that I could use in the shower. It was GREAT for that purpose, and also proved to be an awesome all-around portable bluetooth speaker. Sound quality was great for the price range and size. Volume was SUPER as well. I loved the big loop on the back that you could hang on all sorts of things. I LOVE the concept of the Magic Button in the center to Play, Pause & Skip. The Skip Feature is ESPECIALLY hard to find on a speaker in this price range and I love it for use at work when I may not be able to easily access my phone. Bluetooth connection was great. Battery life originally lasted anywhere between 4-6hrs at least which was great. THIS SPEAKER LASTED ME AT LEAST 5 YEARS with little to no change in quality. I LOVED THIS SPEAKER! Unfortunately, I left it at work one week when I was on vacation and just left it there figuring my coworkers could use it and would respect it enough. Long story short, I came back and it wasn't working as well or holding a charge properly. It was a sad end to a good story.🔍Finally, I find myself in need of a new speaker. Because I LOVED my original WONDERBOOM so much, I decided to search within the Ultimate Ears line.((It also just so happens at my current job our department owns two WONDERBOOM2 speakers! I've noticed their battery life doesn't work as well, but they still worked pretty decent.))So I wanted one of the newest, nicest speakers in the Ultimate Family. The Hyperboom was too large to transport from home and work, and cost way more than I was looking to spend, so that was out of the question. So immediately I decided to research between the BOOM3 & the MEGABOOM3. In conclusion, through reviews I read I concluded that most consumers felt the bass was overpowering for the Megaboom3 with no real volume increase, and simply diminished the quality of the sound. SO, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE BOOM3!1️⃣🆕First impression out of the box, it looked nice enough. I preferred the more compact design of the Wonderboom, and DEFINITELY missed the larger, more practical loop. It still has the magic button which is a HUGE selling point to me and very accommodating.I charged it up to 100% and decided to unplug it and test it out for a while at home. It worked well, sounded almost exactly like the Wonderboom as far as sound QUALITY. I might be wrong but as far as VOLUME goes I feel it may have had the same volume limitations as the original Wonderboom, if anything maybe SLIGHTLY louder. However, I was happy it seemed to be fully functioning and worked just as well as my other one.I also liked that in addition to that, I was able to use the Ultimate Ears app in conjunction with the product to REMOTE START the speaker from my phone. Again, this is another HUGE selling point to me because I mainly use this product at work. It also has an EQUALIZER function which is definitely cool, although I don't feel like it's very accurate. It also has some sort of feature where you can set certain clicks on the Magic Button to play certain playlists automatically, which sounds cool although I never got to personally try it.All in all, it seemed like a good replacement at first.⚠️🪫THE NEXT DAY COMES & HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEMS BEGIN. I come into work with my charger FULLY charged at 100%. I use Remote-Start on the app to turn on the speaker. The Remote-Start feature also displays the approximate battery percentage (by 10% increments) of the speaker. At this point, my speaker was at 100% charge.I used the speaker for between 1.5hrs<2hrs before it gave me the Low Battery warning for 10%. So, I put it on the charger and continued to let it play. It lasted maybe another 20minutes, before it died.Now this is VERY disappointing considering my ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM that came out 5+ years ago would last for 4-6hrs on FULL VOLUME without being on a charger. Not only that, but the ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM would ALSO last for a WHILE on the charger even when battery wasn't full.This was disappointing, but didn't seem like a crisis, just a bit sad.The next day, is when the BIGGER issue began. I admittedly forgot to charge my BOOM3 when I got home the night before, and then brought it to work. When I wake up, I charge it until I leave for 1.5HOURS!When I arrive at work, I charge it for an additional 1HOUR before, checking the battery percentage on the app which reads 60%. So, I decide to turn it on and use it while STILL LEAVING IT ON THE CHARGER. NOT EVEN 30 MINUTES GO BY UNTIL THE SPEAKER DIES!!!!!!!!! So, irritated I turn it off, opt for my AirPods and leave the speaker to charge for a few hours. I let this SPEAKER CHARGE FOR 4 MORE HOURS BEFORE USING IT. Finally, I check the battery on the app which only says 40%????? So I turn on the speaker and leave it plugged in, IT LASTS FOR LESS THAN ONE SONG BEFORE DYING!LET ME TELL YOU, THIS SPEAKER BROUGHT OUT PURE RAGE IN ME AT WORK. 🪫⚠️😡I feel so pissed, and cheated and ripped off. I was such a big fan and advocate for the Ultimate Ears brand, but how are you gonna sell me a NEWER, MORE EXPENSIVE speaker and MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY worse. Considering this is the BOOM3, I WOULD HOPE & ASSUME IT IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL WONDEBOOM FROM 5 YEARS AGO, BUT I GUESS NOT. Thanks, Logitech, just charge me more money for a FAR INFERIOR PRODUCT, with the illusion that is going to be somewhat improved. However; this speaker is simply, for my needs- UNUSABLE & FRUSTRATING!!! HUUUUUGE DOWNGRADE 👎😢Very, very disappointed in the Ultimate Ears brand for putting out this one. Like I sad it really is a shame because I was a HUGE supporter of their brand and unfortunately this product was so disappointing and frustrating that it has ruined my relationship with this company for good.I loved the convenience of the Magic Button with the Skip Feature, the portability, durability, great waterproof technology, super big, useful loop, the sound quality & volume, and the battery life of ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM, but this product has ruined all that unfortunately.⚠️DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR MOMEY 💸 BECAUSEYOU WILL NEED TO RETURN IT & REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER SPEAKER!!!!!!! THIS SPEAKER IS NOT FUNCTIONAL! ⚠️Sorry, Ultimate Ears, but do better.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2022",AFSWDPDFGUZCY4TIBMKU2QD3275A,1,148,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker,Ultimate Ears,6438,1158,Low (1–2),False

R1BSI08ET2JUBA,B0B44F1GGK,4.0 out of 5 stars A good rugged/waterproof speaker from Sony,Customer Review,4.0,"This Sony SRS-XE200 (Sony has the best product names, am I right?) is a tall cylindrical shape, but I don't think it has a 360 degree orientation like the old Amazon Echo speakers. This one fires out of the mesh on just one side, in one direction. If you have ever owned a pair of Sony earbuds or one of their sound bars, you will be familiar with their mobile apps. This one uses ""Music Center"" for changing any settings more advanced than changing the volume, this is also where you can update the firmware over bluetooth. This speaker supports Google Fast Pair, so if you have an Android smartphone, this makes pairing it super easy.The only negative thing about this speaker (from my perspective) is the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack for using a wired connection. This is purely bluetooth, so make sure you are good with that. It has a built-in microphone for phone calls or summoning a digital assistant (Google Assistant/Siri/Alexa). It does have USB C port for charging, but you cannot plug it up to something like a laptop use it over USB. It has a rapid charging feature, 10 minutes plugged in will equal 70 minutes of playtime. The 16 hour battery life rating seems to be accurate in my testing, that assumes you would be listening at 50% volume (this is always the case for quoted battery life estimates).If you're curious about the drivers inside, as far as I can tell, it is just one full-range driver measuring:42mm x 51mm. But, I'm not 100% sure because on Sony's website, it shows a cutaway diagram that appears to have dual drivers. The default configuration in the app is mono, but this could be because the drivers are arranged vertically (if there are two of them).This speaker is ideal for taking places, it's designed to be very durable and it is IP67 water-resistant (assuming you keep the protective flap closed over the USB C port). If you need one to keep at home on a shelf, there are better options than this for the price, with better sound quality.","Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2022",AH35XWTFCCK7DEATASGPXWVNSETQ,0,0,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRS-XE200,Sony,1979,354,High (4–5),False

R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5.0,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn’t say it’s the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I’m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it’s sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It’s minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a “better” speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don’t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it’s the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you’ll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don’t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it’s kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,0,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+,Beats by Dre,2300,412,High (4–5),True
R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5.0,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you.

It has a “party” setting also. I have a wraparound porch so it stretches the sound out nicely! I like the rubber cover because I use them outside a lot! It was easy to pair it to my phone and to pair up the second speaker. Just follow the instructions provided! This was a great investment because I’m all about music 🎶 and good sound. I even listen to my podcasts using them. You can adjust the speakers either by the controls on the speaker or by your phone, which is really convenient! Even if I’m talking on the phone and want the conversation heard, it can come across the speaker! The USB/C charger cord comes with it. It charges very quickly! I like when you turn it on it tells you what the battery level is at and where it is paired to. These are the best little speakers with a huge sound that I have ever had! But then….it’s a BOSE!!!! The loop on the side makes it possible to hang the speaker easily too. That’s especially helpful outside on the porch where I have a number of hooks for hanging plants! I don’t have to worry about its stability, although it has a nice balance of weight to it just to sit it on a railing! If you like what I described, you will want to own one or more!

R294Q4QN96UURC,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Magnificent Comeback by Sony with the ULT Field 1,Lu,5.0,"Wow, Sony! What a magnificent comeback. This is the best-sounding speaker I've encountered at this size and price. The hourglass shape is great for palming it. Initially, I didn't think I'd like the strap, but I love how tight it is—making it a perfect handle. The speaker can seamlessly stand or sit facing you or directly up to disperse the sound evenly. Doing a Hz test next to one of my Charge 5’s, it easily competes. I did these tests on my mattress to better feel the vibration of each unit. The Sony produced noticeably more vibration than the Charge 5, which blew my mind. Supposedly designed to compete with the Flip 6, it's, in my opinion, better than my Charge 5. Whatever Sony’s engineers are doing, they hit a home run. The clarity is wild, the bass response is wild, and the ULT button sounds like it’s unleashing the Iron Giant, and I’m here for that. Most speakers don't appear on my “connected devices” widget, but this one does. After listening for the last 4 hours at about 50% volume with ULT turned on, I only lost 20% of the battery. Bluetooth connection is swift, taking about 3 seconds from pressing the power button to streaming audio from your connected device. I purchased the orange ULT Field 1. Normally, I go for neutral colors like white, gray, or black, but this orange really pops and looks sweet. It comes with a short 12” Sony-branded USB-A to USB-C charging cable. Sony, you should hook us up with 3-foot cables. Sony has truly outdone themselves with the ULT Field 1. The combination of design, performance, and features makes it a standout speaker in its category.

Sony ULT 1 is awesome and I'll explain why.Bass is still extremely strong but does not drown out the highs and for the first time I hear a mid range. The sound is just so much better compared to JBL. JBL has always sounded hollow to me like I was missing half the sound. Now I realize it's just a small speaker but Sony made me realize I have been missing something. If you want great sound quality Sony does it best. The design is killer I currently have it on my island in the kitchen and it's super easy to connect with my iPhone. Most of all no light show pretty straight forward which I like when I go camping and the beach. I'm definitely going to get the bigger version ULT7 for the pool but wanted to test this one first.

It looks very nice sitting in an office, or even just on a shelf. The small design, is very well made. You can tell the difference right away when you first pick up this speaker, that it is not cheaply made (not that I would expect nothing less form Sony, or any other vendor of this caliber), and the design aspects are on point; to be beautiful and functional at the same time, with much attention to detail of the design.The thing that I wasn't impressed with is the sound. I think this speaker works well at low volumes. If you intend to listen to your music alone or in an office setting, then this may work for you, but don't engage in any high expectations from this speaker.As I mentioned earlier, if you set it on a low volume the sound is really not that bad. I would recommend turning on the ULT button, and never turning it off again for the life of the speaker. This gives it a much fuller sound at low volumes, and if you close your eyes and listen, then you just might hear a hint of bass coming through.If your mischievous, and you do decide to turn the volume up more than half way, then you wil begin to NOT enjoy the tinny sound coming from the speaker, as the clarity immediately fades away.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AFEGGRZ2KH5OZPE5ESYHC2Y4USTA,0,3,Color: Off White,Sony,1273,243,High (4–5),False
R14TDMYNDRULVM,B0CXL4FQBK,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony ULT Field 1 Bluetooth Speaker,M. Hill,5.0,"Featuring enhanced bass this Bluetooth speaker is compact and has noticeable weight for its size which gives it a quality feel. It arrives with a one foot long USB A to USB C charging cable and while it may be operated manually as a standard Bluetooth speaker it may also be controlled by the Sony Music Center app which to fully utilize all the features requires at least a second speaker. A small reference guide is included but a UPC code is provided on the underside of the box lid for an online version of a more detailed manual.For a Bluetooth speaker where portability is the point the sound is surprising good--clear and precise although at higher volumes reproduction is somewhat tinny. The bass boost adds depth which seems all the more necessary in an outdoor setting where acoustics are non-existent. Overall at this price point the speaker has an excellent sound and a solid build. If interested operation details follow.On arrival I plugged it into a USB A charging port during which a small orange LED light located below the power button was illuminated and when fully charged the light went out. After gently pressing the power button a small green light and a small blue light are illuminated. If familiar with Bluetooth pairing the operation is straightforward and if not information is available in the manual. Ready to listen to music I manually connected the speaker to my iPhone music library.The touch control panel at the top of the speaker includes a power, Bluetooth, play/pause, volume minus & plus along with the ULT bass boost control. A water resistant trap door at the back of speaker covers a USB C port for charging. There is a built-in omnidirectional microphone to use during phone calls. The location is not obvious but it is approximately an inch to the right of the control panel and an inch below.Battery life is stated to be 12 hours at level 25 volume which is approximately 50 percent and at full volume 3 hours. The ends on the speaker have a rubberized bumper which should offer some shock protection if dropped. The IP67 rating means it is dustproof and water resistant in up to 3 feet of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. It has a simple removable woven strap for transporting the device.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AHCFDFVAK4QZPXXF35WGU3MVFVDA,0,1,Color: Black,Sony,2236,391,High (4–5),False

This Sony speaker has great sound and isn't too big or bulky.It has a nice rope-like handle for carrying.It connects easily via bluetooth and feels durable. The quality of the speaker seems excellent.It has a ton of extra features which I have not tested. Honestly, I don't often pair multiple speakers or use my speakers for phone calls, but it's nice to know this speaker has those features if you need them.For me, bluetooth speakers need to have good sound and be mobile, as I often take them on the go.

I just turn on my Bose and set my auditory boundaries. It's peace!Oh, yeah, it's small and light enough to easily carry around. The charge lasts hours and hours and it recharges superfast.

I had no interest in a single speaker, I already had an altec lansing for that(though the sound is inferior to these). Unfortuntely, the first thing I tried to do was use the Bose Connect App I down loaded before i even got the speakers. Followed the ""intuitive"" instructions and had no problem pairing with each speaker seperately, but to pair two speakers, either for party mode or stereo(you have to be in party mode to intiate stereo) you HAVE to use the Bose Connect App to go into party mode/stereo. It's been 2 weeks and used at least different devices, and I have only managed to get into party mode twice, SO THATS A HUGE FAIL considering the price I paid to be able to pair two speakers!!!!! It's also a HUGE FAIL on the lack of fast charging in 2023/24!!! The sound on these are good for the size, but if they are lacking the most, it's bass, so a seperate subwoofer option would be a nice addition, IF YOU COULD BUILD EQUIPMENT THAT COULD ACTUALLY PAIR WITH OTHER UNITS WITHOUT FAULTY SOFTWARE TO CONTROL IT FIRST!!!!!! Disappointed in Bose. I have owned a lot of Bose products over the years and through out most of them, Bose stood head and shoulders over most competitors with well built, well crafted, industry standard products, but it's always disappointing when a well trusted brand sells you an inferior product, whether it's material, workmanship, design, or software or all of the above. It sucks when you have 2 of the exact same speakers, but you can only listen to one at a time and the only option you have is to struggle to get the manufacturers app to actually do what it's supposed to be created for. DON'T BUY THIS SPEAKER OR ANY OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS IN THIS SERIES THAT RELY ON THE BOSE CONNECT APP IF YOU WANT TO PAIR SPEAKERS!!!!! IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

I originally ordered 1 unit, and then later that day ordered a second one. DEFINITELY get at least 2! The sound quality with 2 is what I expected from a high quality product like Bose. They are very lightweight, portable, easy to use, and can pair multiple speakers via Bluetooth for full surround sound! Seriously! Download the Bose Revolve + II Soundlink App to control them. It does the thinking for you by guiding you through the pairing and steps controlling the units. Easy peezy. I purchased the cases and flat cradle chargers too. Highly recommend all! 👍I personally like a touch more bass in my music, but these things only weigh about as much as my cell phone for Pete's Sake, so this was completely expected as the rule of thumb is: more bass = more weight, and I wasn't about to order portable speakers that had a little more bass and were going to tire me from just carrying them around everywhere.

While they may lack a battery within the case, reducing the overall listening time, the buds themselves offer an **excellent battery life**. In testing, they lasted just shy of **17.5 hours**, though individual results may vary slightly. Their portability is a significant advantage, making them a convenient choice for on-the-go music enthusiasts.It's true, the absence of an **IP rating** for water and sweat resistance, along with the lack of noise canceling or spatial audio features, might be seen as downsides. However, these omissions are somewhat mitigated by the buds' affordability. The removal of the indicator light, a seemingly small feature we've all come to rely on, is a curious choice by Apple. It's akin to a phone without a camera; it functions, but something feels amiss. Now, users must rely on their phones to check the battery life and confirm if the charging cable is properly connected. For iPhone users, this information is conveniently displayed via an on-screen card, while Android users can find it in the app.Despite these quirks, the Beats Solo Buds strike a balance between **size, sound quality, and price** that many will find just right. For those seeking alternatives, the Soundcore Space A40 offers a similar size, more overall battery life, a wireless charging case, and comparable sound quality with a bit more sub-bass impact. They also boast a comfortable fit with ANC and an actual **IPX4 rating**, all at a price point that's often under $50 on sale, available in black, blue, and white—all of which are quite stylish. Ultimately, the Beats Solo Buds stand out for their portability and sound quality, making them a worthy consideration for those prioritizing these features within this price range.","Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2024",AER7PTMSQZFO5CNGSYDORW6DEDGQ,0,6,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds,Beats by Dre,1904,306,High (4–5),True

The range is just poor, and I can't find any way to adjust it in the app.At $80 I guess I can't complain about it too much, but I thought I was sacrificing things like a battery in the case not actual sound performance.The fit is ok, but multiple times they have fallen out while using on the elliptical and the controls are hard to use because they are physical buttons that force movement of the bud when pressing. On the plus side you don't accidentally pause your music when readjusting like the touch sensitive ones do.Personally, I don't see these as being a daily driver. I think I will throw them in my travel bag so if I forget to pack or don't have room for my primaries, I at least have something.Overall, I don't recommend these, there are much better options in this price range, beats really missed the mark on this release!","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHY5C3OQ4B5WHDQSIPWGFTRCPV2Q,0,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: Solo Buds,Beats by Dre,1087,201,Medium (3),True

They represent Beats' approach to minimalist function, design, but kind of miss the mark.These buds are small. You do have several options of sizing for yours ears, but once those things are in, you want to be careful operating the touch controls as each slight tap feels as though you may be pushing them further into your ear canals.Sound wise, I wasn't too impressed. The highs/mids were decent, but the bass seemed lacking a bit compared to other buds that I've used. I can't really say much on the ANC as I didn't really need it. With enough volume, everything outside was pretty much muted...typical of this style of earbud.There was an app that requested to download that allowed for manipulation of some features, but having to install an app and give up permissions can often be concerning.For phones conversations, these weren't bad.

R3ACA4BFELO1SS,B0D3JB14QS,3.0 out of 5 stars Apple/Beats is walking a middle line with these,This Is Not,3.0,"I've been using these the last couple of days as my everyday drivers. I have tried Beats earbuds before, mainly the Studio Buds and the Studio Buds+. Neither stayed in my ears without relying on foam ear tips. So, I never fully switched to them and returned them for other products. I have a pair of old PowerBeats Pro, but I stopped using them a while back because they don't have ANC and rely on Lightning for charging (which should be a sin in 2024). I've always wanted to like the Studio Buds and Buds+ due to their design and overall solid build, but they never stayed in my ears.The same holds true with the Solo Buds. They're just like the Studio Buds+, just a little smaller and lighter. If the Studio Buds/Buds+ didn't stay in your ears, these ones won't either. I went through all the different ear tip sizes and medium fit me the best, but I had to push the right earbud back into my ear every hour or so.While I had these in my ears, I was able to do some listening. They popped up on my iPhone 15 Pro Max like all other Beats and Apple earbuds/headphones. You get some options in the iOS settings and the drop down menu. Unlike AirPods, these do not feature head tracking for spatial audio (though they do work with spatial audio, so does ANY pair of earbuds or headphones) or any ANC whatsoever. The charging case does not have a battery in it either. These earbuds last for about 17 hours (Apple advertises 18 hours) when I listened to them at about 75% volume.One thing that took me back was just how quiet these were. I had the same issue with the Studio Buds+. I have Soundcheck turned on in Apple Music due to listening to Atmos/Spatial tracks. It turns up their volume to match the volume of other tracks in my library while normalizing track volumes across the board. Still, I have other earbuds and headphones from Sony, Moondrop, and Heavys that don't require my iPhone's volume set to 75% for comfortable listening.Although the battery life is exceptional, charging these is a pain. Like I said, the case doesn't have a battery in it which means you need to be near a power source to recharge these. The case doesn't have a charging indicator light, so you don't know the charging state of the earbuds. Are they full, half, or somewhere between? I don't know, you need to lift their lid to find out. The bottom of the case is flat, just like Sony's case for their WF-1000XM5 earbuds (my everyday pair after I test others). It works for Sony because the case supports Qi charging. The Solo Buds case is begging to have a Qi charger in it. That would have helped immensely with the charging situation. Plop them on a Qi charger with an indicator light and wait for it to turn off. At least then you could tell when the earbuds were fully charged.But nope, Apple cut corners here and the case's only purpose is to take power from the back USB-C port and pipe it to the prongs connecting to the earbuds.Overall, the sound quality is fine, albeit very generic. Bass isn't boosted, neither are trebles. I would say this is a slight V-shaped curve, but not much. People expecting a bass boosted profile should know that these fit in the current Beats sound signature of things being flatter and more accurate. It's a little baffling given the history of Beats and that most people, especially those buying mainstream audio products, like a V-shaped sound signature with boosted lows and highs.I listened to modern pop, some metal, hard rock, and dubstep. It all sounded fine. Details were there, but not as much as my Sony WF-1000XM5. But I expected that given the price difference between these and the Sony earbuds (they MSRP for over 4X as much). There isn't wear detection or anything else fancy. Microphone quality is fine, it works but they do let in more outside noise than I'm used to. There isn't any special microphone noise cancelling like with other earbuds. If there is, I'm not hearing it.The biggest reason why I gave these 3 stars and not more is because, compared to other earbuds, these are far too expensive and should be in the $30 price range. Take the Soundcore A40 earbuds. They MSRP for $80 but are routinely on sale for $60 (sometimes even $50). They have less battery life, ""only"" 10 hours compared to 18. But that 10 hour battery life is while using ANC. It isn't the best ANC, but it's ANC nonetheless and that's something the Solo Buds do not have.The Soundcore A40 also have a companion app letting you adjust the EQ to your liking. It isn't an advanced EQ, but it's better than nothing and I think they sound much better than the Solo Buds. They aren't as quite and my iPhone sits at about 40-50% volume instead of 75% for comfortable listening (not even loud listening). The Soundcore A40 have a case featuring a battery and you can recharge the earbuds 4 more times. Their case also features Qi and USB-C charging with an indicator light. You know the rough battery percentage for the earbuds without popping the lid open. You can place the A40 case on a Qi charger and it will recharge both the case and earbuds without issues.For $20 less (right now), you can get a much better pair of earbuds from Soundcore/Anker that have more features and better sound quality. They don't have a fancy animation when you open them next to your iPhone or Android phone, but you get so much more out of them.Honestly, if Apple put a $30 price sticker on these, I would fully recommend them. You're getting neutral sounding earbuds with some smart features (mainly pairing and automatic spatial audio on iPhones). For $30, it's fine to miss a few features like wear detection and the lack of a battery in the charging case. But, at their current full MSRP (or even down to $50), these just aren't worth it, not for the compromises. If you really need to stick with the Beats brand, I think the Beats Flex are a better buy because they include an Apple chip (better iPhone compatibility) and you can put wing tips on them without ruining their compatibility with a charging case.I've also found the microphone quality to be better with the Beats Flex, it's probably because the microphone is closer to your mouth. I also think the Beats Flex sound better. They're still missing tons of smart features, but they're also often available for $50. They also have a charging indicator light.Honestly, I'm not sure what Apple was thinking with these at their full MSRP. You're paying for a little popup on your iPhone/Android and the Beats name, nothing more. Save money and go with Soundcore/Anker for better earbuds and an overall better package. Either that or, if you really want Beats, get the Beats Flex or wait for these to drop down to $35. They aren't worth more than that.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHIDDYIZWNSZJVM4NNK5Y3ISPKAQ,0,0,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds,Beats by Dre,6711,1205,Medium (3),True

And overall they are decent earbuds but if you're a music holic like me than you may not be too satisfied. I always been a big fan of Sony products and have had their earbuds in the past so I thought these were going to be great for me. Pros: Battery life is amazing! I used them for about a week before the battery was even close to dying. And I don't use them just a few times a day, I listen to music bascally all day long after work and at gym. So I am extremely impressed with the battery life. Also, they feel very comfortable in your ear, you can barely feel they are in there. Another pro is that they are easy to store in their case and the case is small enough to put in your pocket to carry around. Cons: Doesn't have the best noise cancellation and volume is kind of low. I am able to hear a lot of noise even when volume is all the way up. My main thing about earbuds is not hearing the outside world. I like to be focused on me and the music Im listening to. So as much as I loved other Sony products, I will be returning these earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2022",AFAIOY5S42FGEUZ3VYPM5HPB7J7A,1,20,Color: Black,Sony,1119,225,High (4–5),False

R276VWWAGXV6VT,B09CFP6J6D,1.0 out of 5 stars Readme 1st: Not for Windows users... Mediocre sound quality even by Sony standards.,Persepolis,1.0,"This is on the cheaper end of Sony's offerings, given the price tag I would at a minimum expect good quality... wrong. It falls short of a 10 year old wired Sony MDREX58V, at 3x the price...Here are the pro's and con's:Pro: Quick bluetooth connect/disconnects.Con: Audio quality is just BAD... tinny and weak out of the box. It falls short of an older Sony MDREX58V I have which is only $20, it falls short of most $20-$30 no-name ear buds, and falls, and falls pretty close to a set of freebie earbuds I got while flying United a few years back. This is not good! I think Sony tried to differentiate between their high end offerings so badly that they killed the quality on this one so they can fill the lower price tier.Pro: Comfortable fit, lighter than some of the other ear buds I've used.Con: Software to control behavior is only available on Android and iOS... so if you're using it on a Windows PC, while it will pair and it will ""function"", it sounds like crap... and it will stay that way. In 2019, there were about 850mil iPhones in use... and about 900mil Windows PC's in use... not sure the what ledge the MBA's hit their heads on before deciding Windows users don't get the app thats needed to properly use these earbuds. For yuks sake, I do have both an iOS device and an Android... and installed the app on both of those... and the sound quality didn't get much better by adjusting the equalization envelope. Increasing the base just seemed to eat away at the midrange... It was weird to say the least.Pro: It can be reasonably loud. So you're getting mediocre sound, just loud mediocre sound... LOL.Anyways... summary: This is a low price offering from Sony that has been neutered so they can offer you something for $60... the only problem is that it performs worse than the $20 offering from others.Lack of a Windows app was not a particularly good decision given how low performing these are... a little bit of signal processing could have helped save these a bit...Summary: Save your money...

And with this is another problem that if you are in the car your phone start switching between my car entertainment and buds. this is very very annoying. this problem I have with both pairs so it is probably design problem that the saddle for those buds is not really good.- By one of those pair is problem with connection. The problem is that I stop hear the sound and I have to push stop/play bottom to hear the sound again.

R1G28XEXNA4QFG,B09CFP6J6D,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony Quality Shines Through with these Earbuds!,Shawshank,5.0,"I ordered these earbuds because I wanted a quality set of earbuds that weren't a cheap throwaway pair after a year but didn't want to drop the coin on a set of Apple or Bose earbuds. Sony has a good rep in the consumer electronics space and after doing a little research outside of Shamazon, I decided I would give the WF-C500's a shot. A few things I like about these specific buds.1. Fitment - they fit in my ears well and they stay in my ears without causing hot spots or pain points.2. Battery life - I can't give you a precise number, but I can use these earbuds throughout the day and even into the night and still have some battery life in the morning.3. Sound - These specific earbuds I use primarily for listening to Audible audiobooks, so I don't need an eardrum ticking base or eye-watering treble highs, that said I did test these out with a few of my favorite artists - Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, Armin Van Buuren, Tiesto, AC/DC, old Van Halen, Vivaldi, the usual stuff we all listen to and in each style of music, I was very pleased, it was accurately represented within the context of having a half thimble-sized device stuck in my ear. Win. I also use these for phone calls, when someone calls and interrupts my audiobook, and I've always gotten good feedback from the other person on the call, in terms of clarity, volume of voice, and even outdoors, the wind management seemed to not negatively impact my call.4. Earbud controls - There is a pro/con to the way you control these earbuds. I'll flat-out tell you I am not a fan of the touch-sensitive earbuds. I have big hand and rarely do I touch it in the way it wants to be touched and I end up hanging up on someone while I'm trying to turn up the volume or whatever the case is. The WF-C500's are more of a button-press kind of thing. It's tactile - you know exactly what your finger is doing when it's doing it because of that tactile feedback. I freaking love that. Super-duper simple!! So what's the con Shawshank? Glad you asked. It's probably a horrible habit but I use one of the earbuds when I go to sleep. Usually an audiobook, might be some Ludovico Einaudi, or that soothing ocean or thunderstorm sound with some good ol' scripture in the background. The problem is I'm a side-sleeper and SOMETIMES when I roll over to the side that has the earbud in it, the pillow will act like my finger and hit that little tactile button and pause whatever I'm listening to. I can hit it again and be a little more careful when I put my head back on the pillow, but that does happen. It's probably a bad habit anyway, but that's the con of the controls on these earbuds, from my POV anyway.5. Overall quality - I really can't complain about these earbuds. I've dropped them in the sink while washing my face, and forgotten to take them out when taking a shower (I realized after the water hit my head that I was still listening to whatever it was I was listening to, but they got a good dose of water sprayed on them, and there were times where one did fall out of my ear, primarily because I didn't seat it well.I have been so pleased with these earbuds, that I bought my 17 yr old son a pair and he is also very happy with them. He listens to music primarily, 70-80-90's music (yeah he has good taste in music for a teenager.) :-)An update after I had written this. I ran into a problem with the left earbud not connecting to BT. I contacted Sony support because they have a 1 yr limited warranty, and I bought these back in May of last year. We tried doing a full reset, which didn't correct the problem. The CSR provided me the info to send them back, I received an email with a FedEx shipping label, dropped them off at the Fedex in a Dollar General nearby, 2 days later they arrived at the Sony repair facility, 1 day after that, Sony notified they had ordered a brand new pair of WF-C500's for me and I should get them next week.I'm not usually the kind of guy that gets massively butt-hurt when something breaks. Stuff happens. What I don't enjoy is when I am trying to correct a problem, be it a defect or whatever, with the manufacturer or the store and it becomes a battle of will and plain old integrity of service. My experience with Sony was outstanding. They asked me to try and correct the issue by doing a hard reset and when that didn't work, they moved right into replacement mode. I dig and respect that. So I wholeheartedly recommend this product. Unlike the growing number of Shamazonians who get free stuff to test and write reviews even though in all honestly sometimes they don't know crap about the product, I am a guy who buys his own stuff and in this case, I was 110% daily user of these Sony WF-C500 earbuds - at home, in my truck, at the gym, in the kitchen, in the bathroom (oops), outside mowing my grass and running my airplane sounding weedeater, in all cases this audio was good, and most importantly, I didn't lose one out of my ear and run my mower over it. As far as ""noise cancellation"", I will just refer to the numerous times my bride yelled at me because I didn't hear her when she was talking to me. I suppose in some regards that counts as ""noise cancellation"". (my beautiful Brazilian bride, if you happen to read this, you know your man loves ya.)BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front): They feel good in the ear. They sound good in the ear. You don't look like you have a Chernobyl growth sticking out of your ears like some of the other earbuds. Perhaps best of all - Sony sticks behind their products and they understand what excellent customer service should be. These are the factors that drive my review and are the reason I bought a pair for my son, to whom I don't give him a rock when he asks for bread if you know what I mean. But he never asked for these, I knew the pair he had for 3+ years was having issues and wanted to surprise him. He was surprised on top of being happy. That's probably the highest recommendation I can provide, for what I give to the absolute pride and joy of my life - well I can't see these not being good enough for the King of England if they're good enough for my son.I'll TRY to remember and update my review with some pics when I get the new earbuds. Chances are however, that I will forget and probably remember when I'm in a situation that precludes me from executing the review update in that moment I'm thinking about it. But I'll try. BTW the price dropped on these. I paid $90 bucks for my pair and my sons pair, and I think I saw them for $70ish or $79 and they are worth every buck of that even at $90.","Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2024",AE46KEUAAPWZ3CWV3BKSR4PTUBSA,1,8,Color: Black,Sony,6560,1241,High (4–5),False

R3O2F0G4RQELXK,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Movement focused TW earbuds from Beats with great sound,Ant,5.0,"My pair of Beats Powerbeats Pros were starting to die out on me. I had purchased them secondhand so I wasn’t too upset, but I needed a replacement. I decided to get a new pair of true wireless earbuds this time around.After doing some research on the top recommended workout focused true wireless earbuds, it came down to the Beats Fit Pro and the Beats Studio Buds.Ultimately I decided on the more expensive of the two, thinking it would be worth the extra cost. I got them on a sale that was running here which makes it even better. My use case for them would be for gym workouts such as jogging/walking and lifting, and also for casual use at work and home.I’ve had this pair for a little over 1 year and 6 months. I have purchased Apple care + for them but have not had to use it.EXPERIENCE:The sound on these, personally, is really enjoyable! The noise cancelling and transparency mode work so well.If I’m at the gym and don’t want to hear the other people making noise with their machines or the running of treadmills? Turn on noise cancelling and have music on. In a snap, the outside noises seem to be gone.At work and don’t want to miss a phone call?Turn on transparency mode and you’re free to hear sounds around you. Even better with just one earbud in, too.The mic quality on calls seems to be passable, people seem to hear me fine.*Small note: there is a tiny rip in the silicone/plastic on the right bud’s button near the bottom. I suspect this is from wearing them when going to bed sometimes. I usually wake up and find them out of my ears. There are times where they’re still in my ears, but I tend to move around during when asleep.OTHER THOUGHTS:I really like the wing tips on the earbuds, they stay in my ears perfectly. Sure, there was some soreness in my ears in the beginning, but my ears got used to it pretty fast. Also, the ear tip size helps a lot. Make sure you try all the included sizes to really figure out which one is most comfortable.There is definitely a learning curve on inserting the earbuds into your ears. Once you get the method of inserting them smoothly and creating the right seal, they are more enjoyable. Look at one of the animations in the earbud’s description for reference.Plus, the sage grey colorway just looks dope. Wish there was a lava red colorway available like the Powerbeats Pro.These work great with my iPhone and connected to my PC. Can’t speak for performance on an Android device.

R3OU5G5RXBTK3T,B09JL41N9C,"5.0 out of 5 stars Finally, Something By Beats I Can Endorse",Jeff Gomske,5.0,"I work in radio. I've done it for 30+ years and one of the curses/blessings of working with audio is I have grown to understand intimately what really good audio sounds like. I have used countless number of headphones and earbuds (and there 𝙄𝙎 a difference between the two) and there are a few names which stand above the rest, and I'm not going to get into a debate because so-called, 'Audiophiles' will claim they know better (Which begs the question, how does one actually 𝙗𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙚 an Audiophile in the first place? Is there a course you can take, or does one simply give themselves that title? But I digress...) when Beats first hit the scene, they were unquestionably an astonishing waste of money. Their audio quality was maybe a shade above average at best. But, that didn't stop millions of people from buying them at outrageous prices. Well, the uncontested King of over-priced products (apple) got wind of this and did a takeover of their products and an interesting thing happened: their quality got BETTER.Did they become as good as most ""professional"" headphones out there...? Probably not. However, their earbuds did become notably better. I feel it necessary to point out that while Beats headphones were nowhere as good as many claimed, their earbuds from the beginning seemed to be pretty good from the get-go. Their unique ""hook"" style which wrapped around your ear for a secure fit (you either love this style or not - but you cannot argue that they did not fit and stay in place better than almost any other brand out there). Some of their other wired earbuds were still decent as well, if not priced at the upper end of what most people were willing to pay, but at least the earbuds could be counted on to give you an above average experience.Apple buys them out and reorganizes the entire company. Suddenly they are no longer all over the place like they used to be. Famous people were no longer wearing them everywhere you looked. Then apple releases their Beats branded earbuds, the Powerbeats Pro. Love them or hate them, they made an impact.They were also equipped with apple tech like their H1 chip which made them instantly compatible with iPhones (a pretty smart move, actually) and the audio was excellent, especially for working out. Then they release the Beats Fit Pro.A radically different design. But - a welcome one, especially for someone who loved the Powerbeats great audio quality, but not the hook design. Again, it's hard to please everyone when it comes to something that fits inside your ears that have so many different possible sizes and an almost infinite number of differences from one person to the next...like the apple airpods, one size fit 𝙢𝙤𝙨𝙩...and if you were one of the people they did not fit, well you were kind of SOL. At least with the Fit Pro they opened up better fitting to a much larger segment than the airpods and with the included wing-tip design, they immediately caught the eye of many athletes who need earbuds which stay put while sometimes being fairly aggressive in their workouts. If you were not a fan of the Powerbeats hook style, the Fit Pro's must have looked like a gift from On High.FIrst off, they really DO sound great. Good bass without going too deep. Music NEEDS good bass, but if it thumps too hard, it will ruin audio in more ways than I can describe here. Mids and Highs were also both pretty crisp and not overly isolated. The blend just works. Whoever tuned the Fit Pro should be commended for doing such a great job.ANC was...disappointing. To be fair, to get great ANC into such a tiny device really IS a challenge and oftentimes going all-in on this feature usually means you sacrifice audio quality. In this case, Beats chose to put more into the audio than into the ANC. I had a difficult time even recognizing that it was even turned on at all. Maybe my pair simply isn't doing it's job. However, the OnePlus buds Z2 has ANC that is actually pretty good and still has really impressive audio as well, so I'm not exactly sure why the Fit Pro's is so difficult to even tell if ANC is on or off, but I can only review what I have and that seems to be the case with my particular pair.The wing-tip design really works well - for me at least. They provide a pretty good fit and they stay put incredibly well. My biggest problem with earbuds is exactly that. Either they'll fit well, or almost not at all. It doesn't seem to fall anywhere in between. My OnePlus buds Z2 sound great, but I constantly find myself adjusting them in my ears - which honestly is annoying. The Fit Pro's (at least in my case) I set them in, twist to secure the wing-tip and they just stay put. This is going to be subjective since everyone is slightly different, so keep in mind my experience with how they fit in my ear may not mirror your own.You can do a little customizing with the app. I do have an iPhone but I primarily use an android, so I downloaded the app and you can to a bit of customizing, however, not as much as I would have liked to have seen given what these earbuds are capable of. I believe the iPhone integration has quite a bit more options than the android counterpart. This seems to be more the norm these days as apple and Samsung work hard to reward you for buying products that are more in line with their products than the competition. I wish they'd both put an end to this childish bickering and open up all their products that can be used on other platforms to include all the options that they would have if you paired it with an iPhone or a Samsung. Either you want your customers to get the best bang for their buck or not.I like the physical buttons the Fit Pro uses. You'll know by touch that you've pressed it instead of simply the ""touch"" controls which in my experience can be hit or miss. When they work great, it's awesome. But do they all work perfectly every time? Of course not. With buttons, they seem to work pretty much 100% of the time and that's something I appreciate.No wireless charging. At this point, especially for the cost, that really is something they should have included. Is it a deal breaker? For some it very well could be. It wasn't for me, but I love wireless charging and think every pair of wireless earbuds over $100 really ought to include it. I know earbuds that cost under $40 that do, so to not include it here seems to be almost an insult. They use USB-C charging which IS convenient however. Beats claims they have fast charging however, in fact they call it ""Fast Fuel"" where just 5 minutes of charging will net you an hour of listening...I haven't been able to check this, but I CAN state that they do seem to charge pretty quick, so that may negate some of the disappointment of not having wireless ability, but necessarily so.The case is pretty nice, too. It is quite a bit smaller than the case for the Powerbeats, but still larger than what you get with the airpods. I honestly didn't mind the size at all, so this one is also going to be pretty subjective.For the most part, these are the first apple made earbuds that I can recommend even if you own an android device. The audio is stellar and they seem to hold a charge for about an average length of time for earbuds of this size. I rarely listen for more than about an hour, maybe 2 at the most, so I'm not the guy to look for with advice on listening at length (unless it's for headphones, then I can make a LOT of recommendations). Honestly, I'm happy with mine. Are they perfect? No. But are they worth it? I sure think so.***UPDATE***I purchased some memory foam eartips...not sure that this was a wise decision. Not because they don't work or fit well, but because they are slightly larger, it means fitting them back into the charging case either they won't charge or they'll be problematic to fit properly. Now, in all fairness, this wasn't an issue with the smallest foam eartips, but the medium and larger ones did not like to fit back into the case. They also did not really make any noticeable difference is audio quality, so I switched back to the original tips they came with.

The first problem is that the ANC is not as good as you would think. The second problem is the lack of good bass. I mean these are Beats. They cost sooo much compared to earbuds from lesser known brands, and so you would think that they would be the best quality, but they aren't.I am not a name brand person at all.

Well, they do stay in my ear which is the one positive.Now on to the disappointing negatives.1) ANC - the active noise cancellation is there, but it isn't as strong as my other earbuds that were less than half the price of these Beats. I am using them at the gym, and they just don't cancel out as much noise as my others and I am super disappointed in that. I can still hear too much ambient noise.2) Bass - the bass on these is sorely lacking. Again, my less expensive earbuds have way better bass than these - the known name brand expensive earbuds. I literally stood there in my kitchen and traded the Beats back and forth in my ears with my less expensive ones and no matter how much I tried to have the Beats come out with greater bass, they just don't.So in the end, for me, these are mediocre quality earbuds for way too much. I don't know if we're allowed to mention other brands on here so I won't but I will say that the overall sound quality and the ANC on my cheaper earbuds is way better. Again, the one positive is that these don't fall out of my ears. All that for so much more money.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AFU6RZBAB6LPD5ZRQP3VMCS6NSKA,1,4,Color: Tidal BlueStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats by Dre,1704,336,Medium (3),True

RFVMZ1TEOIUYS,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Kim K Beats,KK,4.0,"The media could not be loaded. Ugh I never write reviews but going to just this once for the hell of it! Gave this a 4 out of 5 stars but in my words here’s why…Purchased these in replace of the newest AirPod Pros… AirPods were constantly falling out my ears, hurting my little tiny ears, a(n)extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant time. 0 out of 10 do not recommend! Seriously. I think this is good decent product. You can say I’m pretty satisfied with my purchase. First off, love the color. Really adore that part. Purposely purchased the color because not only is it giving baddie.. it blends with my skin tone, damn near perfectly. So when I’m at work, or even if my hair is up, or just even out and about, people can’t even tell I have earbuds in. Very discreet and convenient for that reason. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been asked if they are hearing aids at work lol. They also do not fall out whatsoever. Like seriously. These babies ain’t going no where. Haven’t tried working out in them yet but I think it’ll be fine even with sweating. Really great sound quality, features (ex. noise cancellation *chefs kiss*), and super comfortable. Love that you can adjust to whatever shape or size your ear is! Along with the buds being very flexible. Even hours after wearing they may start to get a little uncomfortable and you can fix and adjust them so you don’t have any issues. Audio is excellent and great phone call/FaceTime quality as well. No complaints with sound. When i’m on the phone people be hearing TOO much lol. The ONLY negative(s) I have to say are that honestly probably wouldn’t purchase them again not for sound or feature reasons but the overall quality for the price! Definitely way over priced but I get it because it is a Kim Kardashian promoted product.. but atleast make the material more attractive and sturdy in regards tothe quality. Case that the beats are stored in is very light weight .. like too light. It really feels and looks cheaply made. Like they should be $45 at THE Walmart Supercenter .. Love the flexibility of the buds themselves but dislike the overall quality of the case the earbuds are stored in. The case also charges the buds as well and lasts throughout my 12 hour shift with battery to listen and not having to charge them at any point during my shift. I’ve really only seen it had them die a couple of times on me and that’s really my fault for forgetting to charge them lol. Really wished they could’ve used a more sustainable and STURDY material. Otherwise, everything else checks out and I will say that these are wayyy better than AirPods (at least for me and my small ears) and for reference I have had each version of the AirPods. Very comfortable, can tune people and surroundings out so easily. Love that part. ANYWAYS thanks for reading! That’s the Tea✨✨ hope you decide topurchase!! You may or may not regret it lol. I do not suggest for people with LARGER ears. xx","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2023",AF5Y6SZCJXNTDXRECVDQLQHLCELQ,1,156,Color: DuneStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats by Dre,2943,532,High (4–5),True

The bass from the Beats sounds amazing and the fit with the wingtip is excellent. I never could get my AirPod Pros to fit properly even with 3rd party ear-tips and they were constantly falling out of my ears!These Beats have the H1 chip, Active Noise Cancelling, Spacial Audio and are 'Find My' compatible. I've paired them with my iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPad Pro and Mac Studio with no issues.The only negatives would be that the included USB-C cable is very short but shouldn't really matter since most people have numerous longer cables. The bigger issues is with the case. It's extremely light weight and very slick so it could possibly be easy to drop. I just ordered a cheap silicon case for it which I really shouldn't have had to do if they designed it better in the first place. And it doesn't support wireless charging like the newer AirPod Pro cases if that's important to you. Even with those slight negatives I would still highly recommend these over the AirPod Pros.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AHB2P6TOYCKYGRCECL6IEOB6GN6Q,1,3,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats by Dre,1076,194,High (4–5),True

R1TO6XEYG3PL57,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Such An Amazing Product from JBL!!!,Sherry G McKinney,5.0,"I am an avid music fan and appreciate good sound. I wear buds at work 5 days a week for around 8 hours a day. I was pleased with my Beats Studio Buds, they are great, but battery really sucks. I started searching for a replacement with the same quality and much better battery life when I came across these. I’m not the type of person that will drop $250 on the new AirPods Pro 2nd gen because they’re supposedly the best and are super popular. I believe in “bang for your buck” and audiophile like sound without having to shell out too much. Now it takes a lot to impress me, I’m a dj and know what premium audio is. JBL makes great stuff and have been around for 75 years. I compared all the features and they are so similar to the AirPods Pro. Got them @ a steal of $99.99 on sale, normally $149.99! Lemme say everything about these buds is fantastic! The fit/feel is tight and comfortable and comes without fear of them falling out. The sexy blue finish is so appealing and total “eye candy.” The battery is wonderful @ 40 hours total including case with 10 hours in the buds alone! JBL is a brand that’s well known for their innovation and reliability as these earbuds are a clear representation of that. They are built solid, have terrific call quality and the noise cancellation is the best I’ve ever heard in a pair of earbuds. The best part about the Live Pro 2’s is of course the stellar sound that features powerful rich, hard-hitting, and deep bass notes combined with perfectly balanced crystal-clear highs + mids. The 11 mm drivers really shine and the detail comes to life without distortion, for the frequencies don’t overpower each other. You can pump up the volume and not worry about blowing them. I tried out the app EQ but my problem is that you can only use it with both buds in as well as not having enough presets. I listen to primarily EDM and have to customize to my liking because I prefer a lot of bass, “warm” mids, and “crispy” highs. I don’t prefer to listen to music flat. It would be nice to have the EDM presets such as “dance” and “electronic” available. I found that the “jazz” setting is pretty good. Other than that these absolutely rock and can go head to head with the AirPods Pro 2nd gen. They contain the exact same size of drivers. Maybe they’re aren’t as good, but indefinitely very close. Do yourself a favor, save some $$$ and get these Live Pro 2’s!","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2024",AEFYW3RIBSE4NB3VQPUQS2YDX2UA,1,21,Color: Blue,JBL,2396,446,High (4–5),False

R3GHZWZVCHJ6WS,B09V9P5Q6W,5.0 out of 5 stars 2019 Airpod Pros vs. 2022 JBL Live Pro2,Quick Reviews,5.0,"tldr; JBL wins all categories except for ANC, slightly wonky pause/play, and lag (depending on your device).Airpod Pros 2019: I was gifted the Airpod Pros by my brother for use with my iPhone. I started to use it with my Windows 10 laptop and iPhone. Connecting to Windows is cumbersome but doable. At one point, I had to tweak the windows registry to get it to recognize the AirPods. Windows 11 changed the Bluetooth audio stack to support AAC and what that means is if there's no audio being played through the AirPods for about 5-10 seconds then it shuts off completely and takes another 5-10 seconds to turn back on (to save battery I heard). This just produces an initial audio start up lag. Think 1970's Kung-Fu lip-dubbing.Apple AirPods Pro 2:- Battery life is at 4 hours with ANC, 4.5 with ANC off (Each firmware update had made the ANC worst. Source: Reddit Posts)- Audio is neutral all around to please most consumers but its nothing exciting. Bass is definitely lacking.- Bluetooth 5.0, Apple H1, and lightning port connectionJBL Live Pro2:- Multi-connections (Maximum of 2 devices). I have my iPhone and Windows 10 laptop and they jump back and forth seamlessly.- If the earbuds have nothing in range to connect to them it auto defaults to ""Discovery Mode"". Pretty convenient.- 8-10 Hours playback easily (These are my EDCs and I have been using them for about 4 months now).- Touch controls! Yes! All your basic audio, ANC, and Alexa/Siri/Google. No volume but I'm completely fine with that for this price range.- ANC has AI auto-adjusting environment setting via app (App is on the GooglePlay and AppStore). It is slightly weaker than my AirPods. I tested by snapping my fingers on each earbud.- Earbuds do offer pause/play when removing them from your ears but its slightly slower vs. AirPods. The pause/play uses vibration more than the motion when I'm placing the earbuds back into your ears. Putting it in my pockets can cause audio to resume. ***Be aware of this***- Low profile LED lights on each earbud to give you light indicators of your battery, BT connectivity, and if audio is paused or playing.- App offers more audio fine tuning controls via app compared to AppleConclusion:It uses a USB-C charging case and its form factor is smaller than the AirPod Pros. It offers almost triple the battery life per session and double the features of the AirPod Pros. It does have a bit of an audio lag on my iPhone and laptops but so did my other non-Apple Bluetooth earbuds.Bonus: This review is completely subjective. This is the first audio product where I don't feel discomfort after my usual 8-10 hour sessions. It destroys my AirPods and Anker (latter having the worst fit and comfortability) in every way. Fitting is S+ tier and I don't have that constant worry or feeling that my earbuds will fall off.These review has been edited on 9/17/22 and are my currently daily drivers for the past 4 months for my WFH role and leisure.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2022",AFJYLFDBAE4YXQ7TPWMTPV6A32DQ,1,85,Color: Black,JBL,2950,510,High (4–5),False

I did have to EQ to unbury the vocal fundamental 150 - 500hz (boosted this +2db). The EQ controls in the app allow to EQ pretty specifically. Now, this EQ change is dependent on your ear canal & ear cup size — for me the vocal fundamental was buried. I have to use the large cups. JBL & other companies should make curves for different cup sizes, as their “vocal” preset EQ boosted the nasal and harsh frequencies of vocals. They should contract a professional music mixer for these EQ curve presets. They should do the same for movie EQ curves. Aside from out of the box EQ, JBL products are capable of producing warm bass, and smooth mids and highs — I didn’t really touch the mid & high frequencies besides the soft slope falling from the vocal fundamental boost. Now that the ANC is good and doesn’t cut out giant chunks of frequencies from the music is very awesome — thanks for figuring that out.

R357ZLBP3YRC07,B0C345M3T7,4.0 out of 5 stars Comparison to XM4 and Bose QC2,Janine,4.0,"I'll keep it brief since others have reviewed more thoroughly.First thing, and I'm shocked to say this-- they actually are tricky to pull out of the case because of the shape and smoothness. It's unbelievable that a huge company can make a product so good in some ways and then just like, what, not actually try to use it before mass-production? It's genuinely worth removing a star for. They could have put just a ring of textured area or a silicone band embedded; or just a little ribbing. It would have been trivial, and should have been obvious from the first test.I think I read someone say they wanted a way to distinguish between left and right. There is a small but obvious bump on the left bud, for this purpose.Bose are more comfortable-- there just is no comparison. If you get a combination of tips and wings that fit your ear, it's like you've got nothing at all in your ear. It is THAT good. The Sony XM4 was irritating by kind-of rubbing against the inner ear when fully inserted. The XM5 have resolved that by being very slightly shorter. They are comfortable if you are used to in-ear buds, especially well-sealing ones. They will never be as comfortable as the Bose.XM5 sound quality is very similar to XM4. I prefer the sound of the XM5 to Bose for almost anything. The Quietcomfort 2 really emphasizes a kickdrum and then bass is muted. It's probably somewhat adjustable in the app EQ, but I didn't try. Percussion like shakers, cymbals, hats, etc all sound more realistic on the XM5 than the Bose-- the Bose makes them sound both synthesized/""fake"" and undefined at the same time. Mind you, the Sony is not audiophile grade-- if you have nice cans then you will definitely find the Sonys lacking. But they're great for what they are, and better than the Bose.Bose takes longer to turn on and connect (several seconds), but they take less time to get comfortably situated in the ear.Noise cancellation-- Bose are noticeably (10-15%) better at cancelling white noises (fans, air purifier, airplane). So for a long-haul flight where that and comfort are most important, the Bose win. Sony, however, did better at cancelling out sudden noises and voices, as well as background music. So for the gym, Sony's win.But really, for most people, it's a toss-up. I wouldn't recommend upgrading from the XM4, and the difference between the Sony and Bose will mostly come down to preference for comfort. If you never find earbuds comfortable, get the Bose, be happy, and don't look back. If you like the Sony sound signature and fit, and are due for a new pair, I do recommend the Sony WF-1000XM5.I'll update this when I figure out a way to mod the buds to be easier to remove from the case.

R8G2XNS5K9IWO,B0C345M3T7,3.0 out of 5 stars Sony has us fooled,Scott C,3.0,"TL/DR: Sony makes sleek looking, clean sounding headphones with all the bells and whistles, and they've parlayed that into an image of ""the best"". They're not... Not by a long shot.I bought the XM4s because they had every feature you could imagine and all the reviews said they were the best, and I enjoyed them, despite the fact that they became extremely painful to wear after an hour or so. Bought the XM5s because they were supposed to be the same but lighter and smaller, but the pain still came, just after two hours instead of one.Sennheiser was my favorite brand before Sony and the Momentum 3 buds have 90% feature parity, so I ordered a pair to see if they were any more comfortable, and whether I'd even miss LDAC.My first impression was that the Senns felt more premium and the touch controls were easier to use. I loaded up the app and found that to be a much better experience, with far deeper customization options. I set the touch controls exactly how I wanted them - something I could never do with Sony's app - and sat playing with the sound personalization widget for the better part of an hour, marveling at how it was able to highlight the specific tone and details I enjoy most without muffling everything else like Sony's basic eq does. Then I started in on my test reel, and had to swap from Sony to Senn multiple times to make sure I wasn't hallucinating...Sony sound is clean, slightly warm, well balanced, with a surprisingly open soundstage. All in all it's better than average and generally inoffensive. ""Good enough"" for most people, myself included, or so I thought.Sennheiser sound is music injected directly into your brain. The highs soar, the bass thunders, and every drum beat is a Muay Thai whip kick to the cortex. The Sonys are simply laughable in back to back comparison testing.Even when listening to the few streaming services that support LDAC I can't tell any difference from APTx, and the Senn quality absolutely annihilates Sony regardless of source. After a while with the Senns I realized that there hadn't been a single cutout, something I had grown used to with the Sonys. Went running and immediately noticed the absence of the hollow thudding noise that accompanied every footfall while wearing the Sonys. The noise cancellation is close enough as makes no difference, and the ambient mode works well. All the automatic on/off, start/pause, etc stuff is there, and the Senns can connect to 3 devices at a time vs Sony's 2. Best of all: no pain, none. Where the Sonys are very comfortable at first and get increasingly uncomfortable over time, the Senns start off feeling slightly intrusive and then disappear from awareness entirely.Sound is very subjective so I can't promise that everyone will share my experience, but if you appreciate sound quality at all, you owe it to yourself to test them side by side. I honestly can't fathom how an professional reviewer could do so and not put the Senns on top by a wide margin. Having done so myself, I feel like I've been living in the Sony matrix for the last two years, and Sennheiser just unplugged me.","Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2023",AE7PVXZHCY3VWMP5HRD6H2SQEFDQ,1,14,Color: Black,Sony,3103,543,Medium (3),False

The sound quality is also one of the main reasons why i like this product. The equalizer, Dolby atmos and so on are very nice features.The cons: The fitment is great but I have weird shaped ears so many earbuds don't stay in my ears. The Bluetooth will intermittently cut out or lag out, and I have a Samsung S23 Ultra so I'm not sure why this does this. I had the older WF-1000Xm3 (best earbuds) so I had to have this pair which by the way, never cut out on sound or connection. The charging case also isn't quite up to par with its claims (bummer).Overall though, this pair of earbuds is awesome and although alittle older already, the price isn't too steep for what you get.

R2Y1T8BV9EOOPM,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars BOSE: Does not dissapoint,Gabe,5.0,"Over the course of the last several years, I have had several different types of headphones. My job allows me the time to listen to anything while I work. I started with some Bose Quiet Comfort several years back (which i still have and they work fine). Bass and clarity on the Bose QC is phenomenal, but using it for calls was a bit of a problem because the clarity on the microphone was a bit lacking, but for music and everything else, amazing. I decided to try a pair of Beats Studio 3's which were also amazing, a bit better when making calls and had a little more loudness than the BQC's. I stuck with those for several years, a pair stopped working, I bought another pair and still have those and have another brand new pair in reserve that I got at a good price...just in case. I tried a pair of AKG in ear headphones that were good. I tried some Samsung buds which were decent but less bass than I liked, which the AKG possessed. This past Christmas I decided to try the Beats Buds and they were better than both the AKG and the Samsung buds, in volume, clarity, and bass. I like a lot of bass in my music and the Beats buds seem to work well and the bass was good. Still, always felt there there may be better out there either way...even as good as these Beats were.There was.I bought these Bose Quiet Comfort Ultras to see if THESE could be ""that better"" that I was searching. They were more than better. The sound quality is off the charts, with the app you can adjust the bass and it is mind blowing. I was working and I could hear the buzz of the air conditioner, but when I put on these headphones: silence. I thought the AC turned off by chance, right when I put the headphones on...I took them out...and all i could hear was the AC. These headphones silenced everything around me, all I could hear was my breathing. I was in shock. I still am. The music quality is unlike any headphones I have had. I've only used them for 3 days, but my God, Bose really is on another level. I will see how these last but if these first 3 days are any indication, I am sure I will be in heaven for as long as I have these. I haven't really messed with the app yet, but I am sure that it will make these headphones even better.If you are wondering if there is anything better out there like I did: There is. Give these a try...its Bose. Ive always known that Bose is next tier, but I had no idea they were this epic.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AES3S3CIMKBZJDXJWHVEMP7QSI3A,1,4,Color: Moonstone Blue,Bose,2416,469,High (4–5),False
R1NKXX3175EXHL,B0CD2FSRDD,1.0 out of 5 stars When will I learn my lesson that Bose is not for me?,Amazon Customer,1.0,"I'm on a never-ending quest for good noise-cancelling earbuds. I work from home and need to block out the incesscent noise from neighborhood leaf blowers and the creepy ice cream truck that loops through our neighborhood every day. But I also need to focus and can't stand music that's too loud, so I need the volume to be able to adjust very low. I'd prefer more than 8 hours of listening time but I know that's a stretch for earbuds with good ANC.So far, the two best pairs I've found for my purposes are the Sony LinkBuds S and the Soundcore by Anker Liberty 3 Pro. The Edifier TWS1 PRO and Soundcore by Anker Space A40 have also not been too bad, although the ANC and the volume reduction is not where I need them to be. I also use an older pair of Apple airpods with my Apple devices. They're probably the most comfortable but the noise-cancelling and volume reduction isn't good enough for my needs.Most days, I switch betwen the Sony pair and the Liberty 3. The Sonys fit so well. They're comfortable. The sound is great. The noise cancelling is pretty good, some leaf blower noise sometimes creeps in. The Liberty 3s are a little bulky but the sound is good and the volume reduction is the best out of all the many earbuds I've tried. The noise-cancelling is good but not great. Those pesky high notes from the ice cream always slip in and the drone of leafblowers in the background is usually still present, although they bring it down to a tolerable level.Now that it's Spring, the windows are open and the leafblowers are out, I got in my head that I needed to resume my quest for the perfect earbuds. In case the technology has magically improved so much in the last two years, I guess. Everything I've read online names the Bose QuietComfort Ultra as the best for noise-cancelling and sound. Well, I've had Bose headphones in the past and was seriously underwhelmed. Not being able to lower the volume low enough to focus and work was my biggest complaint. For just listening to music for fun, they're great but I need my earbuds/headphones as a work tool. Not only does the volume not lower enough, when I'm not thinking about it and try to lower the volume a click and they're already at their lowest setting, they give you this obnoxious, jarring ""bong"" noise that scares the crap out of me. I never figured out how to get rid of that so my headphones have been collecting dust for the last four years. Since it's been a while and everyone still raves about Bose, I thought maybe they've improved.NOPE. These QuietComfort Ultra buds are so insanely loud, even on the lowest setting. Even dropping the EQ to -10 across the board doesn't help. The immersive audio is actually nice. I like it. Again, if I only wanted to listen and enjoy music, they sound great. Well, except for the ANC. The ANC is so loud and fuzzy, I feel like a dog with my head hanging out of the window with these in. Seriously? THIS fuzzy static is the exceptional noise-cancelling people rave about? My $79 Liberty 3 Pros don't sound like I'm going through a wind tunnel, why do the $300 Bose? As I'm sitting here typing this, I just caught the high tinkling notes of the ice cream truck too. It definitely blocks more of that annoying jingle than any other buds I've tried but...that's about the only thing it excels at.I'm not an audiophile by any means, so I'm sure I'm not using the right technical terms. I have noise-sensitivity issues (obviously) and I need to have long periods of extreme concentration while I'm working. I have like three things I want a pair of earbuds to do. Block out irritating, rage-inducing noises, play music at an extremely low volume, and be comfortable. Maybe that's too much to ask? I've tried a few different price points and can not quite find exactly what I need. I feel duped by all the people who review Bose with such glowing praise, that has just not been my experience with any of their products (I have one of their speakers too that's just meh.)Will I have learned my lesson, that Bose is not for me? Only time will tell. I wish Amazon still allowed people to comment on reviews, becuase I'd love to know if any more experienced audio lovers have some suggestions for me.","Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2024",AFZKLW6LMGR3THTDJQPE3L25FU5A,1,14,Color: Moonstone Blue,Bose,4206,763,Low (1–2),False
R1FZJEA9SC5QU1,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars NEVER AGAIN! - I'm so annoyed with Bose,Amazon Customer,3.0,"UPDATE 7/2/2024:I am officially finished with Bose. These earbuds WILL NOT hold a charge when stored in the case. The case has never been over charged. Every single time I want to use the damn things, after I know they should be charged, they say ""battery low"". I officially finally hate them. The annoying, loud low battery warning a few hours after falling asleep with them in was enough on its own.I got these for $249 on sale in late 2023. Good, but Bose made bad choices.I waited for a very long time before getting these, due to price. I read many reviews first. I've noticed an audible faint hissing sound with the ANC. That's already kind of a bummer, but they do seal well and the active nose cancelling (ANC) works well. It's designed for constant, consistent noise rather than sudden unpredictable noise sounds (like my car travel mate's blasting 90's rock).FYI - NO ""noise cancelling"" products of any kind seem to actually fully block out car stereo when traveling as a passenger.Battery doesn't last all night to help reduce insomnia by listening to music or white noise to block out disturbances. Instead, these wake you up at 3am SAYING ""low battery"" instead of just auto shutting off, going on auto standby, or quietly just turning off. I hate electronics that talk, and I'm taking away stars for that, and may even return these due to it. People buy these precisely to NOT BE DISTURBED lol. I really wanted to rate only 2 stars because of how annoying that is, when you already deal with insomnia, but I know not everyone's the same. So 3 or 4 stars is the best I can give.I opted for these over the Sony's because I read these stay in ears better, and had glowing reviews. I'm not willing to risk losing an earpiece worth $300 because it wasn't designed to stay in place very well. No matter other issues I may have with these, at least they stay in and sound great.The case, unlike the Sony's version I read about, does not have wireless charging capability (bad choice by Bose) and they charge more slowly, I believe, without the ""fast charging"". Supposedly Bose makes a $50 additional accessory for this (which cancels the savings of buying these on sale $50 off), but when I went to look at it, it had bad reviews of what seemed like genuine customers lamenting the high price and bad quality of it. So I got a cheap silicone case cover instead, just to protect it and still don't have wireless charging.Anyway, aside from these few gripes, the sound quality produced is excellent. Very immersive. I'm not a big fan of touch controls on something so small, though. Adjusting position or hair etc, or a pet can easily end a call or change the song or volume accidentally and unpredictably. They do sit well in the ears and stay put pretty well. I only even considered this small form due to portability, but I absolutely do not approve of how small these are and how easy to drop from hand, at this price point.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AEOCDBTNK2A4IAM3SKMWMLKNWNFQ,1,20,Color: Black,Bose,2932,527,Medium (3),False

I listen to all types of music in this and it's giving me details I have never heard in listening to music, especially loft or lo-fi music to brain out at work and concentrate on worksheets and lines of code. I find myself just stopping what I'm doing and really listening to the music because I'm hearing elements I've missed and just go wow. When listening to movies, for the short time I had it attached to my fire tv cube, immersion kinda messed with tint of voice.the way the single ear wear auto adjusts to let more ambient noise in when the other earbud is out of ear is a very cool feature and welcomed. talking the same but this is not new, but does it well.ANC is Bose quality and beats my wh-1000xm4 headphones.

R1H3D43QM4MOQ4,B0CD2FSRDD,"3.0 out of 5 stars The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Earbuds - A good set, but not at the price",Susan A. Dunlap,3.0,"I was looking for some new earbuds to take with me on casual walks and for engaging in general listening sessions to relax. I've been a fan of Bose products for a while now and was eager to give these earbuds a try shortly after their release as my original Bose QC earbuds recently broke after two years of use. My review will be broken down into three categories: Features and Function, Comfort, and Sound and Battery Life.Features and Function - these earbuds need to be registered to a valid Bose customer account to be properly used. I have no problem with it as I currently own one other Bose product. However, I have noticed that there were times I could not properly access the headphones in the Bose Music App when I was engaged in my music. This more commonly occurred after around 45 minutes of continuous listening. I've also noted times when the earbuds were not in perfect sync with one another, and I've had to take them in and out at times to readjust them to my ears. However, the app does allow you to modify your preferred EQ (albeit a simplified one) and touch control settings, toggle immersion mode, and provide a way to check whether a proper ear seal has been achieved for both buds to help optimize your listening experience. Where Bose was potentially greedy here was the decision not to provide the included case with a wireless charging capability (they now offer a case with this feature for $50 extra). The call quality on these is decent, but nothing noteworthy compared to the competition.Comfort - By far, the most comfortable earbuds I have ever tested. The earbuds are relatively light, which helped them stay in my ears. I experienced no listening fatigue while wearing them with ANC on. On the note of ANC, these are also exceptionally great at isolating lower frequencies and could very well be among the best the market has to currently offer as other reviews might attest.Sound and Battery Life - This is in part where the earbuds fell short of my expectations. If you are prioritizing sound quality over ANC use, it might be more preferrable to look elsewhere. In this generation, the QC Ultras offers an immersion setting with two modes that provide uniquely different experiences, and turning this setting on does improve the sound quality incrementally at the cost of around 2 hours of battery life assuming this setting remains on for one full cycle. Even in adjusting the provided EQ, there were times that I felt the sound was a little off on the highs, but they do a good job on the mid-range tones and have a desirable the bass response (this is where the sound improvement, compared to the original QCs, was most notable).Now to the big question - are they worth the $300 price tag? In short, probably not. In summary, they have a good (not great) sound, exquisite comfort and ANC capabilities, and a simple set of settings that can be modified via the Bose Music App, but do not provide other features such as wireless charging for the included case that you might expect at this price point. Placing these earbuds at 3 stars is the best I can do for the time being, and I hope this motivates Bose to do a little better when they come out with their next set of earbuds. These were returned.","Reviewed in the United States November 5, 2023",AEWD5BBOB5BS5PJCXKN6NRXSOIQQ,1,14,Color: Black,Bose,3242,578,Medium (3),False

Lower engineering quality,Brian Myers,3.0,"I'm pretty loyal to Bose, but the newest earbuds, while they have better quality emitted audio are of lower quality than previous products. Wind is more of a factor than it was 2 generations ago. They regularly lose the sound envelope and need to reestablish. The touch controls are much less user friendly and adjustable than 2 generations ago. The initial connectivity is less than 80%. Frequently, one has to place the earbuds back in the case, allow them to reset, and then put them back into ones ears as upon initial use one of the buds fails to activate or the sound is diminished.Since no other quality earbuds possess wings, I still prefer to use Bose, but after 2 weeks of use, I'd rather use the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds than Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. If someone else adds stabilizers beyond the silicon tips (or foam) in my ear canal, I'll probably switch.","Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2024",AHOFHJNLFZ2LRBA57YOJ67TS4M6A,1,0,Color: Moonstone Blue,Bose,876,153,Medium (3),False
R7EA0N8OGGF5V,B0CPFV77W4,5.0 out of 5 stars Bose Ultra Open Earbuds Fantastic,Steve,5.0,"I received the Bose Open Earbuds a week ago after ordering from Amazon, delivery was quick and the next morning I was opening my new buds and preparing to put them through their paces, I own many other brands of earbuds from all over the world, even open earbuds from other brands.Unboxing was pretty straightforward. The only things in the box were the earbuds, the case, and a USB-A to USB-C cable. The case feels premium, along the line of other cases I have from other premium earbuds. The case feels comfortable to hold, easy to carry in my pocket. What stands out to me with the case is the lights, I’m not exactly sure why, but when you place the buds in the case and the lights are lit up I really like how that looks. I also like there were no ear tips included, there were none of those here. No fitting the different ear tips then unsure if I have the right ones selected.I was not used to just setting something into my ear and not worrying trying to completely seal up my ear canal. Once I got used to setting these in my ears, it was well worth it. I really didn’t even feel them on my ear. No feeling the pressure that builds up with a sealed ear canal, no popping them out to hear someone talking to me, no uncomfortable feelings at all. According to the website it shows most people wearing them high up on their ears, but for me they fit, feel and sound better down lower on my ears. You just set the earbud into your ear, wrap the elastic part around the bottom of my ear and away you go. I enjoy the best of both worlds, I have my music or my audio books with me wherever I want to go without worrying about the what I cannot hear while crossing the parking lot. I wear these in the park for my morning walk, and don’t get that paranoid feeling that someone is walking up behind me like I do with noise cancelling ear sealing headphones. I can still hear the important things going on around me.The sound is fantastic! I really like music on these. The charge lasts a good portion of the day, I haven’t had any problems yet with them running out of battery. They’re IPX4 rated, so I’m not worried about wearing them while I work out. And I’m surely not worried about having them fall out, I tried my best and couldn’t shake them out. They’re not multi-point capable yet, supposed to come as a software update. But I’m happy with that, I have had enough run ins where I’m listening to a book on my phone then start playing a game on my tablet and having to fight to make sure the sound is coming from the device I want it to come from.Overall these are great earbuds, flew right to the top of my list and are my favorite now.

RMUOUD7MP5T5M,B0CPFV77W4,5.0 out of 5 stars Unmatched Comfort and Versatility: Bose Ultra Open,Alexander Kolozvary Jr.,5.0,"After trying numerous wireless earbuds that either felt uncomfortable or constantly threatened to slip off, I finally discovered the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds – and they've completely exceeded my expectations. Comfort was my primary concern, especially for those long office hours, and these earbuds have truly delivered on that front. Even after hours of wear, I hardly notice they're there, making them perfect for extended use during workdays. For office days, these earbuds are an absolute game-changer. Their open design allows me to remain aware of my surroundings while still enjoying my music or taking calls. Whether it's conversing with colleagues or tuning in to virtual meetings, the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds seamlessly blend into my work routine. I was pleasantly surprised by their performance during outdoor activities as well. Recently, while working on my car's brakes, I wore them, and they didn't interfere with my tasks at all. Their ability to deliver both music and important ambient sounds made maintenance tasks a breeze. The standout feature of these earbuds is undoubtedly their open design. Unlike traditional earbuds that seal off your ears, these sit comfortably on the outer ear, offering a unique balance between audio immersion and environmental awareness. They're ideal for activities like jogging or cycling, where being attuned to your surroundings is crucial. Connectivity and functionality are seamless with the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds. Pairing them with my iPhone 14 was effortless, especially since I already had the Bose Music app installed for my Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar. The touch controls on the earbuds are intuitive and responsive, making it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, and manage calls. Battery life is impressive, offering up to 8 hours of continuous playback on a single charge. With the included charging case providing an additional 16 hours, I never have to worry about running out of power while on the move. The only downfall I could find is the current retail price. If you're not a hurry, I would wait for the holidays when these are surely going to be discounted some. Looking forward to continuing using these and putting them to test further.

They fit nicely ""hugging"" your ear without discomfort. I would wear other ear buds and worry that they would fall out. But with these, I haven't had that issue.First, out of the box, you will notice that the case feels like a quality material. You'll also get a USB-A to USB-C charging cable.

The spatial sound gives you the impression that you're listening to your music through standard speakers in your home. So when you turn your head, it sort of sounds like you have speakers in a fixed location.The fit and finish looks like it's very well made. I had used them for several hours and they just kept going. So far, I haven't had the battery die on me during use. I've gone several days before charging them when my other ear buds would die on me after a few hours and needed another charge. Charging these ear buds didn't take long at all and were ready before I knew it. I really like the fact that you don't feel them after a while and forget you have them in.The ear buds have a button on top that has different functions whether you press once, twice, three times or hold. You can answer your calls, skip tracks, or change the volume.I've owned many other premium ear buds, but so far these are my favorite now. I own many other Bose speakers around my home but never had an opportunity to own Bose ear buds. I really love their quality and fit and finish of their products.","Reviewed in the United States March 18, 2024",AHXYBIMYACXKXXZO5BFDK7WZ25ZA,1,0,Color: Black,Bose,1860,349,High (4–5),False

R2XUYU4VTT9WR7,B088KRKFJ3,5.0 out of 5 stars Marshall vs. Bose Soundlink Flex vs. Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore : This Wins hands down.,Kindle Customer,5.0,"Purchased all the three of the above portable bluetooth speakers as the JBL flip I have had for years had only one volume (Loud) and sounded more and more as it was coming through a tin can. When I lived alone I could crank music on my stereo through high end gear in most of the house, but now I have to be more considerate of my roommate. I suspected none of the offerings in the class of speaker were going to be great, but wanted something that at least didn't make my fingernails itch. As I get tired of wearing ear buds/head phones, decided this was the perfect opportunity to try an upgrade. Thanks to all the purchasers who did reviews, it helps to limit the field and I do rely heavily on customer feedback in making a buying decision.So in last place without even listening to anything else was the Bose Soundlink Flex. It only sounded marginally better than the old one I have which is terrible. If that was as good as it gets I would have just stuck with constantly wearing earbuds.In the middle was the Ban & Olufsen Beosound Expore. The sound was much fuller and less muddy. While it wasn't great it was tolerable. A bonus was that you got sound all around so would be perfect when you are working and moving in the room. While significantly heavier and bulkier than the Bose, it was in the middle size wise as the Marshall was without question the largest of the three. The app was nice as well although I don't like using those to control my speakers particularly when working because my hands are usually busy and messy and don't want to be handling the phone constantly. It had a small strap for carrying but it was definitely going to need to be clipped on to something very securely if you are moving around with it.The Marshall won by a mile. The sound was far more full, less muddy and with sound coming out both forwards and rear continued to give an all around sound as opposed to one direction of sound. Perhaps size is a function of sound quality because without question it is the largest. it is also the best looking. As I plan to use this around my house, it is perfectly fine in size and if the sound hadn't been tolerable I was going to go evetn bigger with a plugged in blue tooth speaker even though that would have been a pain in the butt.Am I getting the quality of sound I would prefer? No of course not and I wasn't expecting to as size is a clear element in recreation of sound. I don't know if this will be as sturdy as the other two. Both of them seemed encased in .more shock absorbing materials.This was also the most expensive but not significantly more. Given the vast improvement in sound quality I was more than willing to pay a bit more and the Prime Day sale price definitely helped.I will update with use. I would have posted a video but based on my own listening to reviews, I realize that they are truly not helpful because what you are listening on will be big part of the sound you are hearing.","Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2023",AHJLVEDB5WVDCHC4U5BHOVCBKKCQ,1,0,Unknown,Bose,2947,554,High (4–5),False

From the substantial feel of this speaker to the initial tones when you power it on for the first time, everything screams quality.Once you get it turned on and connected, the real fun begins. This speaker is loud and has a very nice bass presence. Is it going to over-power someone with a huge PA system? No. But it is loud enough that if you set it on your picnic table or on the towel on the beach in the middle of your gathering, you need to be careful to not have it on too loud, or you won't hear your friends and family talking!Bluetooth is super simple to connect, and while it's not necessary, there are Sony apps available for free to enhance your experience with this XE300.While Sony says sound is multi-directional, I found this to be about 90% true; there is one direction where it is obviously louder, but that's to be expected with a speaker like this. Overall, however, the design is great, the quality is outstanding, and the most important feature lives up to the expectations: beautiful, rich sound.","Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2022",AFWJKCZ3MYFCVZTOVBAS46KSP34A,0,1,Color: BlackStyle: SRS-XE300,Sony,1159,210,High (4–5),False

Yes I know they aren't all marketed as equal, but the prices are actually all pretty close (except for the Flare).After connecting them to my Samsung S22 Ultra each, I played 2 different songs on each device. In my opinion the Sony had the worst sound all the four. It sounded cloudy and muffled, even the bass wasn't that good. My wife as well as my 7 year old daughter (who sometimes I think is tone deaf) also choose the Sony speaker as the worst of the 4.I'm not sure if this can be fixed by a firmware update or maybe we just got a bad speaker but I was very surprised on how bad the sound was.I can't really recommend this portable speaker at all.P.S.
